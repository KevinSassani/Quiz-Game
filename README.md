We call this project the "Quiz Game". The game is a quiz where the user is presented with a flag and should then guess the name, capital, and population of the country. Every play round consists of ten flags and for every right answer the user receives one point which means that the user can maximum get thirty points. At the beginning of the game, the user needs to choose the difficulty of the game (easy, normal, hard). The result together with the difficulty will be saved and displayed on the leaderboard where a harder difficulty is prioritized first.
